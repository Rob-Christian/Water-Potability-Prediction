# Water Potability Prediction

insert discussion here...

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a database used in different researh fields about data science. There are nine (9) input parameters namely; pH value, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), trihalomethanes, and turbidity. The only output parameter is the water potability. All of the input parameters are continuous while the output parameter is binary (either 0 = non-potable, 1 = potable).
