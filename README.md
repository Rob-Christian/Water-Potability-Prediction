# Water Potability Prediction
For all human beings, water potability is a must because drinking a non-potable or contaminated water produces illness that might result to death. Here, multiple machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and artificial neural networks) were compared for water potability. ![image](https://github.com/Rob-Christian/Water-Potability-Prediction/assets/59250293/e3d6fdd4-a6df-4314-bc51-c97e00c2db49)

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, a database used in different researh fields about data science. There are nine (9) input parameters namely; pH value, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), trihalomethanes, and turbidity. The only output parameter is the water potability. All of the input parameters are continuous while the output parameter is binary (either 0 = non-potable, 1 = potable).
